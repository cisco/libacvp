        A library that implements the client-side of the ACVP protocol.
        The ACVP specification is a work-in-progress and can be found at
        https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP


Overview

        libacvp is a client-side ACVP implementation.  This library currently 
	has two dependencies: libcurl and parson.  Curl is used for sending 
	REST calls to the ACVP server.  Parson is used to parse and generate 
	JSON data for the REST calls.  The parson code is included and compiled
	as part of libacvp.  libcurl is not included, and must be installed 
	separately on your Linux host, including the Curl header files.

	This code uses features in OpenSSL 1.0.2, but not present in OpenSSL 1.0.1.
	Many Linux distros still ship with OpenSSL 1.0.1.  Under this situation
	you will need to download, compile and install OpenSSL 1.0.2 on your system.
	This would typically be installed into /usr/local/ssl to avoid 
	overwriting the OpenSSL that comes with your distro.  When doing this, the
	next problem is the libcurl on the Linux distro may be linked against
	OpenSSL 1.0.1.  This will result in linker failures when trying to use
	libcurl with libacvp and OpenSSL 1.0.2.  Therefore, you may need to
	download the Curl source, compile it against the OpenSSL 1.0.2
	header files, and link libcurl against OpenSSL 1.0.2.  OpenSSL 1.0.2
	is used for AES keywrap support, which isn't available in OpenSSL 1.0.1.

        libacvp will register with the ACVP server, advertising capabilities to
	the server.  Currently only AES-GCM is supported.  The server will 
	respond with a list of vector set identifiers that need to be 
	processed.  libacvp will download each vector set, process the vectors,
	and send the results back to the server.

        The app directory contains a sample application that uses libacvp.  The software 
	that uses libacvp for crypto validation will be responsible for writing
	a similar app for their platform.  acvp_app is only provided here for 
	unit testing and demonstrating how to use libacvp.  The application 
	layer (acvp_app.c) is required to provide the crypto module that will
	be FIPS validated.  In this example it uses OpenSSL, which introduces 
	libcrypto.so as a new dependency when compiling the app.  The OpenSSL
	development package needs to be installed on your Linux system.  

        The certs directory contains the certificates used to establish a TLS
        session with well-known ACVP servers.  libacvp requires one or more  
	trust anchor certificates that can verify the identity of the ACVP 
	server.  The NIST ACVP server currently uses a self-signed certificate,
	which is included in the certs directory and can be used as the trust 
	anchor.  libacvp also requires a client certificate and key pair, 
	which the ACVP server uses to identify the client.  You will need to
	contact NIST to register your client certificate with their server.

        The murl directory contains experimental code to replace the Curl
        dependency.  This may be useful for target platforms that don't support
        Curl, such as Android or iOS.  Murl is a "minimal" Curl implementation.
        It implements a handful of the Curl API entry points used by libacvp.
        The Murl code is currently in an experimental stage.

Quick Start

        This has been tested on Ubuntu 14 and Centos 7.

        1) make
        2) source scripts/cisco_setup.sh
        3) ./acvp_app
